What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The directory is marked as a git repository. The next thing to do is to add files to that repository in order for their changes to be tracked.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area represents an intermediary step between the directory and a commit and, thus, the repository. It can be compared to a snapshot of specific files belonging to the directory, at a specific point in time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

One way would be by adding only one item at a time to the staging area and then commiting it.
